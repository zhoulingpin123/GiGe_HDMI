TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock hdmi_clk_gen_inst/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin hdmi_clk_gen_inst/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock hdmi_clk_gen_inst/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_out2_ddr3_clk_gen and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_pll_i and clk1x_hdmi_clk_gen_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_pll_i] -to [get_clocks clk1x_hdmi_clk_gen_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hier -include_replicated_objects -filter {NAME =~ *temp_mon_enabled.u_tempmon/device_temp_sync_r1_reg[*]/D}]' of constraint 'set_max_delay' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '4' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
